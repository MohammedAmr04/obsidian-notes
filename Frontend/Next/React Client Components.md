# Why Client Components Are Important

Client components are essential when the UI needs to be **interactive**. Examples include:

- **Form Input** → handling user data entry and validation.  
- **Toggle** → switching settings (e.g., on/off).  
- **Modal** → opening and closing dialogs dynamically.  
- **Drag & Drop** → rearranging or moving items in the UI.  
- **Animation** → adding smooth transitions and micro-interactions.  
- **Theme Switcher (Dark/Light mode)** → dynamically changing the UI theme.
