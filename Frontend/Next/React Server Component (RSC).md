# Why RSC (React Server Components) is Important?

- ⚡ **More lightweight for the browser**  
  Processing happens on the server instead of the client, reducing bundle size and improving performance.

- 🔍 **Better SEO**  
  Content is rendered on the server, making it easier for search engines to crawl and index.

- 🔄 **Simpler Data Fetching**  
  Data can be fetched directly on the server during rendering, reducing complexity on the client side.
- The page is **static** or mostly static.
